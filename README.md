# <Calendar-App>

## Description

Used existing starter code to create a functioning day planner app that users can save their events and come back to even if they have left the app. Utilized local storage to create this feature.



## Code and Tech

I utilized VS Code in order to modify the exisiting HTML, CSS, and JS files to create a functioning application. 



## Features

Applied functions and concepts recently learned to use local storage to store the users info in the application. Other features include the following:


-The user can utilize time blocks from 9AM - 5PM and insert text accordingly
-Time blocks are color coded by past, present, and future 
(gray, red, green)
-Local storage saves the users data
-Clear fields button allows user to clear all data and begin again
